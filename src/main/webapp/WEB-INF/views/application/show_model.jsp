				    A time series is a series of data points indexed (or listed
					or graphed) in time order. Most commonly, a time series is a
					sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. Thus
					it is a sequence of discrete-time data.
				</p>

				<p>
				    Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time
					series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other
					characteristics of the data. Time series forecasting is the use of
					a model to predict future values based on previously observed
					values. While regression analysis is often employed in such a way
					as to test theories that the current values of one or more
					independent time series affect the current value of another time
					series, this type of analysis of time series is not called "time
					series analysis", which focuses on comparing values of a single
					time series or multiple dependent time series at different points
					in time.
				</p>
				<p>
				    Here we use time series to predict CPU workload in cloud
					computing, we can find that it is an easy way to process the CPU
					time series data which have a natural temporal ordering.
